# Fix Failed CircleCI Builds Example

This example demonstrates how to analyze and resolve build failures from CircleCI using the MCP Server API.

## Overview

The example shows how to:

- Query failed builds from your CircleCI projects
- Retrieve detailed build logs for failed builds
- Parse and analyze the logs to identify failure patterns
- Implement fixes based on the analysis

## Prerequisites

- [CircleCI account](https://circleci.com/signup/) with [Personal Access Token](https://circleci.com/docs/managing-api-tokens/)
- NodeJS 18+ installed

## Steps

1. Create a GitHub repository with contents of this directory
2. Create a CircleCI Organization and a project named `fix-failed-builds` and connect it to this GitHub repository.
3. Generate a CircleCI Personal Access Token.
4. Push the code to GitHub and trigger a CircleCI build. The build will fail because there's a deliberate error in the package.json file (the build script contains a typo: `next buildss` instead of `next build`).
5. Now you should see a build failure in CircleCI pipeline.

6. Configure the CircleCI MCP Server in your IDE. View setup instructions [here](https://github.com/circleci-public/mcp-server-circleci/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

7. Go to the IDE and open chat in agent mode. Ask the agent to `fix the issue from ci`.

8. The agent should make the tool call and retrieve the build logs.

9. Now you can make a commit to the repository and push it to GitHub. This will trigger a new build in CircleCI. You should see the build passing.
